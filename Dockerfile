# Camoufox remote Playwright server.
#
# Camoufox is a patched Firefox (no Chromium) tuned to resist bot detection.
# We bake the patched Firefox into the image so the container is self-contained
# and does not pull hundreds of megabytes on every cold start.

# We install the cloverlabs-camoufox pip package, not the original camoufox
# one. The original has been frozen on PyPI at 0.4.11 (Jan 2025, Firefox 135)
# since the maintainer stepped back; cloverlabs-camoufox is the same wrapper
# published by the project's current active maintainer and is endorsed in the
# upstream README. It still downloads the official browser binaries from
# daijro/camoufox GitHub releases, so only the wrapper comes from the fork.
ARG CAMOUFOX_VERSION=0.6.0

# The browser build to fetch, pinned separately from the pip wrapper. Since
# 0.5.x the wrapper no longer hard-pins a browser; a bare `camoufox fetch`
# resolves "latest in channel" by the camoufox build label, and the ordering
# quirk (beta.24 sorts above alpha.26) makes it pick the old Firefox 135 build.
# Pinning an exact version sidesteps that and keeps the image reproducible.
#
# Upstream ships different build labels per architecture for the same Firefox
# version (the lin.x86_64 asset was rebuilt as alpha.26), hence two ARGs.

# Pin to bookworm on purpose: several runtime libraries below (notably
# libasound2) were renamed with a t64 suffix in Debian trixie, so a floating

# FF150 and claims the "alpha.25" label, so the arm64 FF150 build
# (150.0.2-alpha.25) never makes it into the sync cache and `fetch` cannot
# see it. Dedupe by the full version string instead. If a wrapper bump makes
# this sed a no-op, the fetch verification below still fails the build, so
# drift cannot slip through. Revisit whenever CAMOUFOX_VERSION is bumped.
